                <h4>ANAEROBIC DIGESTION</h4>
                <p>Anaerobic digestion is a biological process where microorganisms break down organic matter without
                    oxygen,
                    producing biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide). This renewable energy reduces waste and
                    greenhouse gases.</p>
                <h4>AGFLATION</h4>
                <p>The increase in food price that occurs as a result of increased demand on food for human consumption
                    and energy.</p>
                <h3>b</h3>
                <h4>BIODIESEL</h4>
                <p>Biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled grease. It's
                    biodegradable and
                    reduces greenhouse gases, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional diesel fuel.</p>

                <h4>ECO FOOTPRINT</h4>
                <p>An eco footprint measures the environmental impact of human activities, calculating the resources
                    consumed and
                    waste produced. It reflects how much of Earth's resources are needed to sustain a lifestyle.</p>
                <h4>EMISSION TRADING</h4>
                <p>Emission trading is a market-based system where companies trade pollution allowances to meet
                    environmental goals and reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
                <h4>ETHICAL CONSUMERISM</h4>
                <p>Ethical consumerism involves making purchasing decisions based on moral values, such as environmental
                    sustainability, fair trade, animal welfare, and labor rights, promoting responsible practices and
                    reducing negative impacts on society and the planet.</p>

                <h4>DECENTRALISED ENERGY</h4>
                <p>Decentralised energy refers to energy generated close to its point of use, often from renewable
                    sources, reducing transmission losses, enhancing energy security, and empowering communities with
                    sustainable, localized power solutions.</p>

                <h3>T</h3>
                <h4>TRUNKING</h4>
                <p>Trunking is a networking technique that combines multiple network lines into one channel, optimizing
                    bandwidth
                    and efficiency. Common in telecommunications, it allows multiple users to share a single
                    communication path.</p>
